Prompts Used During This Project
================================

The following prompts were used across implementation, debugging, hardening, and verification.

1. go through this pdf in detail, and implement each and every feature correctly meeting all the functional and non functional requirements
2. should i install maven or maven daemon
3. how do i install maven?
4. i am getting this error (Maven plugin resolution / No route to host)
5. the issue is not resovled, fix it properly
6. now i'm getting these errors, fix these
7. i am getting these errors after running "mvn -s .mvn/settings.xml test", fix these errors properly
8. now give the commands to run this project
9. java -jar target/high-throughput-fanout-engine-1.0.0.jar config/application.yaml (NoClassDefFoundError), how do i fix this issue?
10. do i need to delete any files that could have been created while running previous commands?
11. why do i get this error on running java -jar target/high-throughput-fanout-engine-1.0.0.jar config/application.yaml (SLF4J / Unsafe warnings)
12. The system must process files up to 100GB. You must not load the entire file into memory. does the code you provide handle this?
13. I can patch pom.xml now to add slf4j-simple so the SLF4J warning disappears. yea do it
14. how do i run this in java21
15. i got these warnings after running "mvn -s .mvn/settings.xml clean package" command, how do i fix these warnings?
16. i want to test this application extensively and rigorously with all the edge cases covered
17. ok give me all the commands to run this project and all the test cases
18. i got this error after running "./scripts/test-rigorous.sh" ... rg: command not found
19. ok now update the readme with all the final changes you've made and make it as detailed as possible, also move the prompts section out of the readme and create a Prompts.txt in the root directory containing all the prompts

Additional internal implementation prompts used during development:

20. Extract all requirements from Assignment_2___High-Throughput_Fan-Out_Engine.docx.pdf and implement complete Java project coverage including ingestion, transformations, sinks, throttling, retries, DLQ, observability, tests, and docs.
21. Expand test coverage to include edge cases for config validation, ingestion parsing, throttling behavior, retry/DLQ flow, metrics integrity, and constrained-heap streaming smoke validation.
